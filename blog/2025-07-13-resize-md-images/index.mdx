import firstLogo from './FIRST-logo.jpg'

When writing Markdown docs, you may find yourself in a scenario where you need to resize
an image. We'll walk through how to resize an image inside of your Markdown file.

{/* truncate */}

First off, the usual way we insert images into our Markdown is like this:

```md
![alternate text](link/to/image)
```

For example, this code:

```md
![FIRST logo](FIRST-logo.jpg)
```

Results in this image:

![FIRST logo](FIRST-logo.jpg)

The logo is a little big, but how can you resize it? 

In Docusaurus, you can actually write `.mdx` files instead of `.md`. The difference
is that `.mdx` supports some `.jsx` syntax and importing. 

JSX is it's own can of worms with lots of features, but what's relevant for inserting
and resizing images is that you must ensure that your file extension for whatever you
are working on is `.mdx` rather than `.md`. This tells the site you are using 
`.mdx` import syntax.

Then, at the top of your file, import the images you are going to use:

:::danger[Don't put imports in frontmatter]

Note that "top of file" here means BELOW the frontmatter (between the two `---` at the top).
If your file has no frontmatter, this doesn't apply to your specific file.

:::

```mdx
import firstLogo from './FIRST-logo.jpg'
```

Then, when you want to use the image:

```mdx
<img 
    src={firstLogo} 
    alt="FIRST Logo"
    width="200"
/>
```

<img 
    src={firstLogo} 
    alt="FIRST Logo"
    width="200"
/>

Note that this is just one of three ways to import images. You can read more
[here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/assets#images) on Docusaurus' documentation.

The method showed here is the recommended way to add images for this documentaiton.
