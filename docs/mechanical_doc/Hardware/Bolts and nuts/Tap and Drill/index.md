# Drills and Taps

## What are Drills and Taps?

Think of it like this:
1.  **Drill:** You use a drill to make a hole
    <img src={drill_bit} width="400"/>

2.  **Tap:** You use a **tap** to cut threads on the inside of that hole, so you can screw a bolt into it.
    <img src={tap} width="400"/>

So, you **drill** the hole first, then **tap** it to add the threads.

## Key Terms
- **O.D. (Outer Diameter):** The width across the outside of an object. For a drill bit, it's the width of the cutting part.
- **Tap (Tap Drill Size):** The specific drill bit size used before threading a hole. Drill this hole first, then use a tap tool to cut threads.
- **Close Fit:** A hole drilled just slightly larger than the bolt, so the bolt fits snugly.
- **Free Fit:** A hole drilled larger than the bolt, allowing the bolt to pass through easily.
