# Materials for prototyping

Common prototyping materials and when to use them:

- Cardboard / foamboard — fastest, cheapest for packaging and clearance checks.
- Baltic birch plywood (laser/CNC) — good stiffness for fixtures and test rigs.
- Acrylic / polycarbonate — good for transparent panels and impact tests (PC for toughness).
- PLA/ABS (3D print) — fast shapes; PLA for quick fit, ABS for heat resistance.
- Foam (EPS/XPS) — light, easy to cut for large-scale mockups.

Note: prototyping materials are for validation; if a part needs final strength, plan a proper material and manufacturing step after testing.
