# Rapid prototyping

Quick methods to iterate designs:

- Cardboard and foam mockups for fit and packaging checks.
- Laser-cut plywood or acrylic for accurate 2D parts.
- 3D printing (FDM for quick shapes, SLA for fine detail).
- CNC foam cutting for large shapes.

Tips:
- Start cheap: validate function before optimizing materials or finishes.
- Keep a versioned photo log of iterations.
