# Mechanical Section Overview

Welcome to the Mechanical section for Argos (FRC Team 1756). This area collects our mechanical design guides, hardware references, calculators, and assembly notes used by students and mentors to design, build, and maintain robot mechanisms.

What you'll find here

- **Hardware** — Physical components including bearings, belts/chains/gears, and fasteners with selection guides and best practices.
- **Calculators** — Useful calculators (belt lengths, gear ratios, bearing life, bolt torque) we use during design.

How to use this section

- Start with the calculators when you need to verify design numbers quickly.
- Browse the Hardware section for component selection guides and assembly best practices.
- Use the hardware guides when designing mounting points, power transmission, or assemblies.
