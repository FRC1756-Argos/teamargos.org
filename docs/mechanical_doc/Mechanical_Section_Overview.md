# Mechanical Section Overview

Welcome to the Mechanical section for Argos (FRC Team 1756). This area collects our mechanical design guides, hardware references, calculators, and assembly notes used by students and mentors to design, build, and maintain robot mechanisms.

What you'll find here

- **Bearings** — Selection guidance, types, mounting practices, and recommended vendors.
- **Belts Chains Gears** — Design considerations, common sprocket and pulley choices, and gearing trade-offs.
- **Bolts and nuts** — Fastener sizing, thread-locking practices, and common shop standards.
- **Calculators** — Useful calculators (belt lengths, gear ratios, bearing life, bolt torque) we use during design.

How to use this section

- Start with the calculators when you need to verify design numbers quickly.
- Use the bearings and fastener guides when designing mounting points or assemblies.
- Refer to the Belts/Chains/Gears guide when selecting drivetrain or mechanism power transmission components.
