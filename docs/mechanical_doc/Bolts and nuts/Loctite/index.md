## What is Loctite?
Loctite is a brand of thread-locking adhesive. It's a special type of glue designed to be applied to the threads of bolts and screws before they are tightened. When the Loctite cures (dries), it hardens into a tough plastic that locks the threads together, preventing the fastener from loosening due to vibration or stress.

## Why Use Loctite?
- Prevents nuts and bolts from coming loose due to vibration or shaking.

## Types We Use
