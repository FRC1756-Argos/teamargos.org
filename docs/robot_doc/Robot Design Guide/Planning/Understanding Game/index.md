# Step 1: Understanding the Rules and Game

## Overview

The planning phase is where you analyze the game, calculate strategies, and determine what your robot should do. **This is the most critical phase because it sets the foundation for your entire season.** The decisions you make during planning will guide prototyping, building, and competition strategy. A strong planning phase prevents wasted time and resources on the wrong capabilities, while a rushed or incomplete planning phase can doom your season before it begins.

This phase has four critical steps that must be completed before moving to prototyping.

## Key Questions to Answer:

### Scoring Opportunities:
- What are ALL the possible ways to score points?
- How many points is each scoring action worth?
- Are there multipliers, bonuses, or special conditions that affect scoring?
- What game elements can be scored, and where can they be scored?
- Where do you score?

### Ranking Points:
- What are the criteria for earning ranking points (RPs)?
- What is the maximum number of ranking points you can earn?

### Game Elements:
- How many game elements are available on the field?
- Where are they located at the start of the match?
- How do game elements become available during the match?
- What are the physical properties (size, weight, shape) of each element?
- Are there different types of game elements?

### Defense and Game Dynamics:
- Is defense allowed in this game?
- How could defense affect your scoring strategy?
- Are there protected zones or time periods where defense is restricted?
- Can opponents interfere with your game elements or scoring?
- What are the penalties for illegal defense or contact?

### Match Timeline:
- How is time allocated (autonomous vs. teleop vs. endgame)?
- Are there time-sensitive objectives or bonuses?
- When do certain scoring opportunities become available or unavailable?

### Robot Rules and Constraints:
- What are the maximum robot dimensions (length, width, height)?
- What is the maximum robot weight?
- What are the starting configuration size limits?
- What are the maximum extension limits during the match?
- Are there any special size restrictions for certain game elements?
- What are the bumper requirements and dimensions?
- Are there any restrictions on mechanisms or deployment?

**Remember:** You can't design a winning robot if you don't understand the game you're playing!
