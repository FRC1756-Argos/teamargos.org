# Phase 2: Prototyping

## Introduction

Prototyping is where your robot design moves from concepts on paper to real, working mechanisms. This is the critical phase of robot development - it's where you discover what actually works, what needs improvement, and what ideas should be abandoned.

**Prototyping is NOT:**
- Building the final robot
- Creating polished, pretty mechanisms
- Spending weeks on perfection
- Getting everything right on the first try

**Prototyping IS:**
- Building quick, rough mechanisms to test ideas
- Learning what works and what doesn't - FAST
- Iterating rapidly based on real-world testing
- Making data-driven decisions about your robot design

:::tip
The goal of prototyping is to **learn quickly** and **fail fast**. It's better to discover a mechanism doesn't work during prototyping than after you've built it on your competition robot!

## What is Prototyping?

Prototyping is the process of building simplified versions of mechanisms to test their functionality, performance, and reliability. A prototype doesn't need to be beautiful or competition-ready - it just needs to answer specific questions about whether a design approach will work.

**Good prototypes:**
- Are built quickly (hours to a few days, not weeks)
- Test a specific concept or mechanism
- Can be modified and tested repeatedly
- Generate measurable data
- Are cheap and use available materials

**Think of prototypes as experiments** - you're testing hypotheses about how mechanisms will perform. Some experiments succeed, others fail, but all experiments teach you something valuable.
