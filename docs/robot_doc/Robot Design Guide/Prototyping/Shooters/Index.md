# Shooters

## What is a Shooter?

A shooter is a mechanism designed to launch game pieces with speed and accuracy. Whether you're shooting balls, discs, or other objects, the goal is to consistently deliver game pieces to a target location. The choice of shooter depends on the game piece type, required launch velocity, accuracy needs, and available space on your robot.

## Common Shooter Types

### Hooded Shooter

A hooded shooter uses one or more wheels spinning horizontally to launch game pieces, with a curved surface (hood) to guide the game piece as it exits the flywheel(s). The game piece is fed between the wheels (or against a single wheel with a backing surface), and the friction between the spinning wheels and the game piece accelerates it forward. The hood can be either fixed or adjustable. Adjustable hood allows you to change the trajectory of the ball based on the hood position.

#### Kicker Wheel

A kicker wheel is an additional wheel positioned usually at the end of the hood. The kicker wheel is usually spun at a different speed than the main flywheel. This reduces the amount of backspin on the game piece and adds more forward velocity for increased range.

### Directional Shooter

A directional shooter uses wheels to launch game pieces with control over trajectory and direction. The game piece travels through or against the wheels, gaining velocity as it's propelled by the spinning wheels.

#### Opposing Wheels

Opposing wheels use two wheels positioned across from each other to grip and launch the game piece. These shooters are aimed by changing the angle of the opposing wheels, allowing you to control the trajectory and direction of the shot.

#### Single Wheel

A single wheel shooter uses a side wall and a center wheel to accelerate the game element. The game piece is compressed between the spinning wheel and the stationary side wall, which propels it forward.

#### Differential Speed

Differential speed shooters use two wheels spinning at different speeds to control the spin and trajectory of the game piece. By varying the speed difference between the wheels, you can adjust the spin on the game element.

### Catapult

A catapult uses stored mechanical energy (typically from springs, rubber bands, or pneumatics) to rapidly accelerate an arm that launches the game piece. The arm rotates around a pivot point and releases the game piece at a specific angle.

### Puncher

A puncher is similar to a catapult but uses a linear motion instead of a rotating arm. A piston or linear actuator rapidly extends to strike the game piece and launch it forward.

### Turret Shooter

A turret shooter is any of the above shooter types mounted on a rotating turret base, allowing the robot to aim and shoot without repositioning the entire robot.
