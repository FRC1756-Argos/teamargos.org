# Indexers

## What is an Indexer?

An indexer (also called an indexing mechanism, sorter, or transfer system) is a mechanism designed to control, position, and manage game pieces inside your robot after they've been collected by the intake. The indexer's job is to move game pieces from the intake to the scoring mechanism while ensuring they are correctly oriented, positioned, and ready for deployment. Think of it as the "logistics system" of your robot.

**Key Functions of an Indexer:**
- **Transport** - Moving game pieces from intake to scoring mechanism
- **Positioning** - Placing game pieces in the correct location for scoring
- **Orientation** - Rotating or aligning game pieces to the proper angle
- **Storage** - Holding multiple game pieces when needed
- **Staging** - Preparing game pieces for rapid scoring sequences

**Important Considerations:**
- **Minimize handoffs** - Each handoff between mechanisms is a potential failure point. Try to eliminate handoffs whenever possible by designing continuous systems that carry game pieces directly from intake to scoring
- **Reliability is paramount** - Indexers must work consistently without jamming
- **Speed matters** - Fast indexing reduces cycle time and increases scoring potential
- **Sensor integration** - Know where your game pieces are at all times
- **Clearance and jam prevention** - Design with enough space to prevent sticking or wedging

## Centering  

Centering is the process of moving a game element into the correct orientation within your robot. This ensures the game piece is positioned and aligned properly for consistent scoring. Centering mechanisms use physical guides, funnels, or active positioning to guide game pieces into the desired orientation before they reach the scoring mechanism.
