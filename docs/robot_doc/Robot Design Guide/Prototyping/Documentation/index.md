# Prototype Documentation

Keep this simple and factual. The goal is to capture exactly how the prototype behaved so others can replicate or improve it.

## What to Document (Actual Performance)
- **Purpose:** What the prototype is intended to do.
- **Performance:** Actual success rate, failures/cause, and real cycle time (not best attempts).
- **Conditions:** Inputs/settings that affected results (speed, angle, spacing); note anything that changed outcomes.
- **Media:** Photos or a short video showing operation.
- **Honesty matters:** Failed tests are valuable—show what doesn’t work and guide improvements.

## Critical Dimensions
Record the few dimensions that make the prototype work. These are the measurements someone must know to reproduce it reliably.

- **Center-to-center distances** (rollers, wheels, pulleys).
- **Compression/gap** at contact points (e.g., 0.25" wheel compression).
- **Heights and angles** (entry/exit height, guide angle, shooter hood angle).
- **Offsets and positions** relative to bumpers/frame and hand‑off points.
- **Material thickness and durometer** where it affects grip or stiffness.
- **Speed/ratio settings** that were required (RPM, gear ratio, duty cycle).

Tip: If changing a number would break performance, it’s a critical dimension.
