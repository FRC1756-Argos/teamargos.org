# Climbers

## What is a Climber?

A climber is a mechanism designed to lift your robot off the ground and attach to elevated structures during the endgame period of a match. Climbing is often a high-scoring activity that can determine the outcome of close matches. The design of your climber depends on the game's specific climbing structure, height requirements, weight distribution, and time constraints for deployment.

## Common Climber Types

### Rope

Rope climbers are designed to climb vertical ropes or cables. These mechanisms typically grip or wrap around the rope and use motors or winches to pull the robot upward.

### Bar

Bar climbers are designed to grab onto and climb horizontal or angled bars. These are among the most common climber types in FRC, using hooks, claws, or grippers to latch onto the bar structure.

### Platform

Platform climbers are designed to climb onto elevated platforms or surfaces. The robot positions itself and uses mechanisms to pull, push, or drive itself onto the platform.

### Bar Traverse

Bar traverse climbers can move horizontally along a bar while suspended, allowing the robot to reposition or reach different climbing zones. These mechanisms combine hanging with lateral movement.

### Assistive/Buddy

Assistive or buddy climbers help other robots on the alliance climb by providing a platform, lift, or support structure. These mechanisms enable teamwork during endgame.

### Chain

Chain climbers traverse or climb chain structures, which present unique challenges due to the flexible, moving nature of chains compared to rigid bars or ropes.
