# Common Mechanisms

This section provides reference material and examples for common FRC mechanisms you might prototype. Each subsection covers design considerations, variations, and example implementations from successful robots.

## Mechanism Types

[Drive Base](Drive%20Base) Drivetrain architectures and considerations  
[Intakes](Intakes) Game piece acquisition mechanisms  
[Indexers](Indexers) Internal storage and positioning systems  
[Lifts](Lifts) Vertical and articulated positioning mechanisms  
[Shooters](Shooters) Mechanisms for launching or propelling game pieces  
[Climbers](Climbers) Endgame mechanisms for climbing or hanging
