# Design Process

## Introduction

The Argos Design Process is an approach to understanding the game, analyzing scoring opportunities, and making informed decisions about what your robot should do. This process is broken into four main phases that guide your team from game analysis to competition success.

### Phases:

[Phase 1: Planning](Planning/Index.md) - Understanding the game, analyzing strategies, and prioritizing robot capabilities  
**Phase 2: Prototyping** - Testing mechanisms and validating design decisions  
**Phase 3: Execution** - Building, integrating, and refining the robot  
**Phase 4: Competition** - Competing, adapting, and improving

This guide walks through all four phases of the Argos Design Process, from initial game analysis to competition success. Each phase builds upon the previous one, creating a systematic approach that sets Argos up for success.
