# 2025 Argobot Challenge: Stash Clash Game Manual

## 1. Overview

The 2025 Argobot Challenge: Stash Clash is played by opposing **TEAMS** on a rectangular **FIELD**. The primary objective is for **ROBOTS** to score **SCRAP** (5-inch diameter whiffle balls) into designated scoring locations (**STASHES**) to earn points. **SCRAP** color determines credit for points and the bonus in the central **COMMUNAL STASH**. Bonus points are also available for a successful end-game **PEDESTAL STASH**.

## 2. Game Pieces

The only game piece used in Stash Clash is the **SCRAP** ball, which comes in two colors (Red and Blue).

| Game Piece | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **SCRAP** | A 5-inch diameter whiffle ball. The game utilizes **40 SCRAP** balls total: **20 Red** and **20 Blue**. |

## 5. Scoring Definition

This section defines what constitutes a score, how credit is assigned, and the rules for all end-game bonuses.

### A. Scored (STASHED) Definition

A piece of **SCRAP** counts as **STASHED** (scored) when:
* It is **fully contained** within the boundaries of the scoring **STASH**.
* It is **fully supported by the FIELD** or the structure of the **STASH**.
* It is **not in contact with a ROBOT** or any game pieces supported by a **ROBOT**.

### B. Scoring Credit Rules

* **Team-Specific Stashes (SIMPLE & ELEVATED):** Points are awarded to the **TEAM** corresponding to the **STASH**, regardless of the **SCRAP** color (Red or Blue).
* **COMMUNAL STASH:** Points are awarded based on the **SCRAP** color.
    * **Red SCRAP** scores points for the **Red TEAM**.
    * **Blue SCRAP** scores points for the **Blue TEAM**.

### C. End-Game and Bonus Scoring

* **COMMUNAL STASH BONUS**: Awarded to the **TEAM** whose color corresponds to the most **SCRAP STASHED** in the single central **COMMUNAL STASH**.
    * **BONUS AWARDED**: **5 BONUS POINTS**.
    * If there is a tie for the most **SCRAP** (by color) in the **COMMUNAL STASH**, neither **TEAM** receives the bonus.
* **PEDESTAL STASH BONUS**: The **PEDESTAL** (4" tall, 4" diameter PVC pipe) is placed by a human player in the **PEDESTAL ZONE** when **20 seconds** are left in the match.
* **PEDESTAL VIOLATION**: If a **ROBOT** contacts the **opposing TEAM's PEDESTAL** after it is placed, the opposing **TEAM** is **automatically awarded the 7-POINT PEDESTAL STASH BONUS**.
* **SCORING**: If at the end of the match, no violation has occurred, and a single piece of **SCRAP** is successfully **STASHED** atop the **PEDESTAL**, that **TEAM** will earn a bonus.
    * **BONUS AWARDED**: **7 POINTS**.
