# Strategic Design Guide

Use this page to explore how design decisions translate into on-field scoring throughput. Adjust the calculator to reflect your current strategy, compare options, and document assumptions alongside CAD or subsystem concepts.

## How to Use

1. Tune the duration of each match phase if an alternate game structure applies.
2. Add or rename scoring actions to match this season's opportunities.
3. Enter point values and attempt counts based on scouting data or design goals.
4. Review section points and points-per-second to look for bottlenecks or underutilized time.

## Next Steps

- Record the assumptions you used in the calculator and link supporting prototypes or spreadsheets.
- Capture lessons learned after scrimmages to refine point estimates and cycle times.
- Pair this analysis with subsystem requirements to keep mechanisms aligned with strategic targets.
