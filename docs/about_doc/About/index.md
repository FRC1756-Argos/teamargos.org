## About Argos

Argos is a FIRST Robotics team that was founded in 2006 and is based out of Limestone Community High School in Bartonville, Illinois. Our students learn engineering, manufacturing, and programming skills while designing and building a robot with professional mentors to compete each year in the FIRST Robotics Competition. The competition season improves students' strategic thinking, observation, and presentation skills as they collaborate with other teams, scout other robots, and speak with judges and spectators at competitions. We aim to promote STEM within our community through various outreach programs and often collaborate with other local teams and organizations to accomplish this mission.
