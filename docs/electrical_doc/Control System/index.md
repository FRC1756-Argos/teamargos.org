# Control System Overview

## What is the FRC Control System?

The FRC Control System is the electronic brain of your robot. It includes all the components that allow you to control the robot - from the main computer (roboRIO) to motor controllers, power distribution, sensors, and the wireless connection to your driver station.

Think of it as everything that takes your joystick inputs and turns them into robot actions.

## Why Do We Need It?

Without the control system, your robot would just be a pile of motors and metal. The control system:

- **Receives commands** from your driver station and makes the robot respond
- **Powers everything** safely by distributing battery power to all components
- **Reads sensors** to know where the robot is and what it's doing
- **Protects components** with circuit breakers and proper wiring
- **Follows FRC rules** using only legal, approved components

## Current Season Details

For specific information about control system components, wiring diagrams, and setup instructions for this season, please see:

**Important:** Each competition season may introduce new components or requirements. Always reference the current year's documentation and FRC game manual when building your robot.
