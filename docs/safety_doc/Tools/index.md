# Tool Safety
 
## Cordless Drill 

- Clamp your work. Use toolbox clamps; don’t hold small parts by hand.
- Choose the right bit: rivnut vs clearance vs tap.
- Chuck it right: insert straight, tighten, tug-test.
- Drill straight (perpendicular). No side-loading—bits can shatter.
- Two hands and a stable stance; set clutch to avoid wrist twist.
- Stop fully, remove the bit, and clean up.
