# Version Control

## Overview

**Version control** is like having a super-powered "undo" button for your entire robot project.

Imagine you're working on a school essay:
- Without version control: You save different versions like "essay_v1.doc", "essay_v2.doc", "essay_final.doc" and get confused about which is the latest üò±
- With version control: You save your work whenever you want, and you can go back to any previous version instantly üòé

For robotics teams, version control lets you:
- **Save progress** - Like checkpoints in a video game, you can save your work at any point
- **Go back in time** - Made a mistake? No problem! Go back to when it was working
- **See what changed** - Know exactly what you changed and when

We use **Git** (the tool that tracks changes) and **GitHub** (the website where we store our code) to keep our robot code organized and safe. Our code is stored in a **repository**, which acts as a central place for all our files and their history.

---

## Repositories

### What is a Repository

A **repository** (or "repo" for short) is like a special folder that holds all your robot's code and remembers every change you've ever made.

Think of it like this:
- **Regular folder**: Just files on your computer
- **Repository**: Files + a complete history of every change

For your FRC team, the repository contains:
- Robot code
- Build instructions
- Documentation
- Everything needed to make your robot work

The repository lives on **GitHub** (like a cloud storage for code) and you can "download" it to your computer to work on it. This is called **cloning** or **pulling** the repository.

---

### Cloning a Repository

**Cloning** means downloading the repository from GitHub to your computer so you can work on it. Here's how to do it in VS Code:

#### Step 1: Get the Repository URL
1. Go to your team's GitHub page (usually `https://github.com/FRC1756-Argos/your-repo-name`)
2. Click the green **"Code"** button
3. Copy the URL (it looks like: `https://github.com/FRC1756-Argos/your-repo-name.git`)

#### Step 2: Clone in VS Code
1. Open VS Code
2. Click the **Source Control** icon on the left sidebar (looks like a branch with dots)
3. Click **"Clone Repository"**
4. Paste the URL you copied from GitHub
5. Choose where to save it on your computer (pick an easy-to-find folder)
6. Click **"Open"** when VS Code asks if you want to open the cloned repository

#### Step 3: You're Done!
- VS Code will open the repository
- You can see all the robot code files
- The repository is now on your computer and ready to work with

**Tip:** If you get stuck, ask a team mentor for the exact repository URL - they know which one to use!


---
## Branches

Now that you have cloned the repository and have the code on your computer, the next step is to create a branch. This allows you to work on new features or changes without affecting the main codebase.

### What is a Branch?


**Branches** are like having multiple versions of your robot code that can exist at the same time. Think of them as parallel universes where you can experiment safely!

#### The LEGO Robot Analogy üß±

Imagine you built a LEGO robot that works perfectly. You want to try adding a new arm, but you're worried you might break it.

**Without branches:** You have to take apart your working robot to experiment üò±

**With branches:** You make an exact copy of your robot and experiment on the copy! If it works great, you can add the new arm to your original robot. If it doesn't work, no problem - your original robot is still perfect! üòé

#### Why Use Branches?

Branches let your team:
- **Experiment safely** - Try new features without breaking working code
- **Work together** - Multiple people can work on different parts at the same time
- **Test ideas** - Try crazy ideas without risking the main robot code
- **Organize work** - Keep different features separate until they're ready

#### Common Branch Types

- **main** (or master): Your "golden" copy that always works (never break this!)
- **feature branches**: Where you build new features (like "add-elevator" or "fix-drivetrain")
- **bug-fix branches**: Quick fixes for problems

#### Branch Workflow

```
main branch (working robot):     ü§ñ---ü§ñ---ü§ñ
                                      \
experiment branch:                     üîß---üîß (trying new arm)
```

When your experiment works, you can **merge** it back into main, combining the best of both!

**Remember:** Branches are your safety net. They let you be creative and take risks without breaking what already works!


### Creating a New Branch

**When to create a branch:** Before you start working on a new feature or experiment.

#### Step-by-Step in VS Code:
1. **Open Source Control** - Click the branch icon in the left sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+G`)
2. **Click the branch name** - At the bottom of VS Code, you'll see the current branch (usually "main")
3. **Choose "Create new branch"** - Click the branch name, then select "Create new branch from..."
4. **Name your branch** - Use a clear name like:
   - `add-elevator-controls`
   - `fix-drivetrain-speed`
   - `test-new-autonomous`
5. **Press Enter** - VS Code will create and switch to your new branch automatically!

### Switching Between Branches

**When to switch branches:** When you want to work on a different version of your code.

#### Step-by-Step in VS Code:
1. **Click the branch name** - Bottom-left corner of VS Code
2. **See all branches** - A dropdown will show all available branches
3. **Click the branch you want** - VS Code will switch to that branch instantly

---

## Committing

### What is a Commit?

Once you've made changes to your robot code, you need to **save** them to Git. This is called **committing**. Think of it like saving your game progress - it creates a checkpoint you can always return to.

:::caution

**Important:** Commits are saved locally on your computer only. Your team won't see them until you push them to GitHub. We'll cover pushing in the next section!

:::

#### When to Commit

- After finishing a small task (like adding a new function)
- Before switching branches
- At the end of each work session
- When your code is in a good, working state

#### Commit Messages

When you commit your changes, you should include a commit message that clearly describes what you committed. This message helps your team and future you understand the purpose of the changes without needing to dive into the code details.

**Good messages:**
- ‚úÖ "Add PID constants for elevator positioning"
- ‚úÖ "Fix autonomous routine timing issue"
- ‚úÖ "Update dashboard with match timer"

**Bad messages:**
- ‚ùå "fixed stuff"
- ‚ùå "changes"
- ‚ùå "update"

#### What Happens When You Commit?

- **Changes are saved** - Git remembers exactly what you changed
- **History is created** - You can go back to this exact point anytime
- **Safe experimentation** - You can try risky changes and always return here


### Step-by-Step Committing in VS Code

1. **Open Source Control** - Click the branch icon in the left sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+G`)
2. **See your changes** - VS Code shows all files you've modified
3. **Stage your changes** - Click the `+` button next to files you want to save (or click the checkmark at top to stage all)
4. **Write a commit message** - In the message box at the top, write a clear description like:
   - "Add elevator motor controls"
   - "Fix drivetrain turning speed"
   - "Update autonomous path for qualification match"
5. **Click the checkmark** - This saves your changes as a commit!

---

## Pushing Changes

### What is Pushing?

**Pushing** is like uploading your saved robot code to the cloud so your whole team can see and use it! 

Remember how committing saves your work locally on your computer? Pushing takes those commits and shares them with everyone on GitHub.

#### The Cloud Storage Analogy ‚òÅÔ∏è

Imagine you have a super cool LEGO robot design on your desk. You've been working on it all day and saved your progress (that's committing). Now you want to show it to your friends and let them help build it too.

**Without pushing:** Your awesome robot stays on your desk - only you can see it üò¢

**With pushing:** You upload photos and instructions to a shared folder online! Everyone can see your work, download it, and even add their own improvements! üòé

#### Why Push Your Code?

- **Share with your team** - Let mentors and teammates see your work
- **Backup your code** - Your work is safe on GitHub even if your computer breaks
- **Collaborate** - Others can build on your changes
- **Show progress** - Demonstrate what you've accomplished

#### When to Push

- After committing your changes
- At the end of a work session
- When you want feedback from your team
- Before switching to work on something else

**Remember:** Push often to keep your team in the loop, but make sure your code works first!

### Step-by-Step Pushing in VS Code

1. **Make sure you're committed** - You should have committed your changes first ([See commiting section](#committing))
2. **Open Source Control** - Click the branch icon in the left sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+G`)
3. **Click the sync button** - Look for the circular arrow icon (üîÑ) at the bottom of the Source Control panel
4. **Choose "Push"** - If it asks, select "Push" to upload your commits
5. **Wait for success** - VS Code will show a progress message, then "Successfully pushed" when done

## Merging Branches (Advanced Topic)

:::info

**Note for Students:** Your team mentors will usually handle merging branches, but it's important to understand what it is so you know what's happening when they do it!

:::

### What is Merging?

**Merging** is like combining two different versions of your robot code into one perfect version!

When you work on a branch (remember our LEGO robot experiments?), you create separate versions of the code. Merging brings those experimental changes back into the main codebase.

#### The LEGO Robot Merge Analogy üß±ü§ùüß±

Imagine you and a teammate both have LEGO robot bases, and you've each added different features:

- You added a stronger drivetrain
- Your teammate added better sensors

**Without merging:** You have two separate robots - you can't use both improvements together üòï

**With merging:** You combine the best of both! The final robot has your strong drivetrain AND your teammate's better sensors üòé

#### Why Merge Branches?

- **Combine improvements** - Bring new features from experiments into the main code
- **Team collaboration** - Merge everyone's contributions together
- **Keep code organized** - Clean up experimental branches after they're tested
- **Release new features** - Make approved changes available to everyone

#### When Merging Happens

- **After testing** - When experimental features are proven to work
- **Team review** - Usually a mentor reviews the changes before merging
- **Milestone completion** - When a feature branch is finished (like "add-elevator" or "fix-autonomous")
- **Code cleanup** - To keep the main branch clean and working

**Remember:** Merging is usually done by experienced team members who can handle any conflicts that arise.

### Understanding Merge Conflicts

Sometimes when merging, Git finds **conflicts** - when two people changed the same part of the code differently.

#### Example Conflict

Imagine you and your teammate both changed the same motor speed setting:

- You set it to `0.8` for better control
- Your teammate set it to `0.6` for more power

Git doesn't know which one to choose! This creates a **merge conflict** that needs human judgment to resolve.

**Don't worry:** Your mentors will handle conflicts. Just know that they happen when teams work on similar code at the same time.

### The Merge Workflow (What Mentors Do)

1. **Review the branch** - Check that the experimental code works and is ready
2. **Pull latest changes** - Make sure main branch is current
3. **Merge the branch** - Combine the changes using Git commands or GitHub
4. **Resolve conflicts** - Fix any conflicts that arise
5. **Test the merge** - Make sure everything still works
6. **Push the merged code** - Share the combined version with the team

**Your role:** Keep your branches focused on one feature, commit often, and communicate with your team about what you're working on. This makes merging much easier for everyone!

## GitHub Issues

### What is an Issue?

A **GitHub Issue** is like a digital to-do card for your robot project. It's a way to track work that needs to be done, bugs that need fixing, or features that need building.

Think of it like this:
- **Without issues:** Team members shout across the room about what needs doing, tasks get forgotten, and nobody knows who's working on what üò±
- **With issues:** Everything is organized in one place! You can see what needs to be done, who's working on it, and track progress üòé

#### What's in an Issue?

Each issue contains:
- **Title** - A short description of the task (like "Add elevator controls" or "Fix autonomous routine")
- **Description** - Details about what needs to be done
- **Assignees** - Who is working on this task
- **Labels** - Tags like "bug", "enhancement", or "documentation" to categorize the issue
- **Status** - Where the issue is in the workflow (Ready, In Progress, In Review, Done)
- **Comments** - Discussion about the task and progress updates

#### Why Use Issues?

- **Stay organized** - Know exactly what needs to be done
- **Track progress** - See what's been completed and what's left
- **Collaborate** - Discuss tasks and ask questions in one place
- **Link to code** - Connect your work directly to the code changes (Pull Requests)
- **Remember history** - Look back at why decisions were made

---

### How to View an Issue

You can view issues in several ways:

#### On GitHub Website

1. **Go to your team's repository** - Navigate to `https://github.com/FRC1756-Argos/your-repo-name`
2. **Click the "Issues" tab** - It's near the top of the page, next to "Code"
3. **Browse the list** - You'll see all open issues with their titles, labels, and assignees
4. **Click an issue** - Opens the full issue with description, comments, and details

#### In the Project Board

Your team uses a project board to organize issues by status:

1. **Go to the project board** - Usually linked from the repository or at `https://github.com/orgs/FRC1756-Argos/projects/`
2. **See columns** - Issues are organized in columns like "Ready", "In Progress", "In Review", and "Done"
3. **Click any card** - Opens the full issue

**Tip:** The project board gives you a visual overview of all work happening on the team!

### Creating a Branch from an Issue

GitHub makes it super easy to create a branch directly from an issue. This automatically links your branch to the issue!

#### Step-by-Step: Create Branch Button

1. **Open the issue** you want to work on
2. **Look at the right sidebar** - Find the "Development" section
3. **Click "Create a branch"** - A dialog will appear
4. **Review the branch name** - GitHub suggests a name based on the issue title
   - You can edit it if you want a different name
   - Good names are short but descriptive like `42-add-elevator-controls`
5. **Choose where to create the branch**:
   - **"Checkout locally"** (recommended for VS Code users) - Shows commands to run in your terminal
   - **"Open with GitHub Desktop"** - If you use GitHub Desktop app
6. **Click "Create branch"**

#### After Creating the Branch

If you chose **"Checkout locally"**, GitHub shows you commands like:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout 42-add-elevator-controls
```

**To use these commands:**
1. **Open VS Code**
2. **Open a terminal** (Terminal ‚Üí New Terminal)
3. **Copy and paste the commands** from GitHub
4. **Press Enter** - You're now on your new feature branch!

**Verify you're on the right branch:**
- Look at the bottom-left corner of VS Code
- You should see your new branch name instead of "main"

#### Why Use the Create Branch Button?

Using GitHub's create branch button has several advantages:
- **Automatic linking** - The branch is automatically linked to the issue
- **Consistent naming** - GitHub suggests good branch names following conventions
- **Easy to track** - Team members can see which branch is associated with which issue
- **Cleaner workflow** - Everything stays connected from issue to branch to pull request

**Remember:** Always create your branch from the issue to keep everything organized!

### Tips for Working with Issues

#### For Students

- **Pick one issue at a time** - Focus on completing one task before starting another
- **Ask questions** - Use issue comments if you're stuck or need clarification
- **Update progress** - Add comments to the issue when you hit milestones or blockers
- **Link your PR** - Always connect your pull request to the issue you're working on

#### Best Practices

- **Read the full issue** - Make sure you understand what's being asked before starting
- **Check for dependencies** - Some issues might depend on others being completed first
- **Test thoroughly** - Don't create a PR until you've tested your changes
- **Write clear commit messages** - Future you (and your team) will thank you
- **Communicate** - If you can't finish an issue, let the team know so someone else can help

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ‚ùå **Don't** assign yourself to multiple issues at once
- ‚ùå **Don't** forget to move the issue through the workflow columns
- ‚ùå **Don't** create a branch without linking it to an issue
- ‚ùå **Don't** push untested code
- ‚ùå **Don't** forget to link your PR to the issue

**Remember:** The issue workflow is designed to help the team stay organized and productive. Following it makes everyone's life easier!
